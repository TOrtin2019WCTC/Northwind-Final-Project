Final Project
Using the Northwind database created in a previous lesson, you will create a console application with a menu driven UI that allows maintenance of selected data tables. The minimum requirements for this project are as follows: 

To receive a maximum letter grade of “C” (405 out of 500 points), your application must perform the following on demand:
Add new records to the Products table
Edit a specified record from the Products table
Display all records in the Products table (ProductName only) - user decides if they want to see all products, discontinued products, or active (not discontinued) products. Discontinued products should be distinguished from active products.
Display a specific Product (all product fields should be displayed)
Use NLog to track user functions


To receive a maximum letter grade of “B” (445 out of 500 points), your application must perform the following on demand:
Include all of the features from the “C” project
Add new records to the Categories table
Edit a specified record from the Categories table
Display all Categories in the Categories table (CategoryName and Description)
Display all Categories and their related active (not discontinued) product data (CategoryName, ProductName)
Display a specific Category and its related active product data (CategoryName, ProductName)



To receive a maximum letter grade of “A” (475 out of 500 points), your application must perform the following on demand:
Include all of the features from the "B" & "C" projects
Delete a specified existing record from the Products table (account for Orphans in related tables)
Delete a specified existing record from the Categories table (account for Orphans in related tables)
Use data annotations and handle ALL user errors gracefully & log all errors using NLog
To receive 500 out of 500 points, your application must do something exceptional, something we have not covered in class. Don’t ask me what it should do, it’s your job to figure it out!
Your instructor will provide extremely limited support on this project. The “C” & “B” level work has all been demonstrated in class as well as most of the “A” level work. Utilize the in-class examples when you need assistance.
